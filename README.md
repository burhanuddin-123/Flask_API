# Flask_API

This repository contains an API used to fetch the
current currency details, and a converter that is
used to convert the other currencies into USD.

As it takes 2 input in json format as,
{
"currency": "INR",
"value": 2
}

Thus currency inicates that which currency we have 
to convert in the USD, and value indicates how much ?

Thus try this API to convert the values of currencies into USD.
